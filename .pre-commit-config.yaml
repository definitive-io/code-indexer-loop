# There are many pre-built hooks that can be added.
# You can see the list here: https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html 
# Adding a hook to this list will add it to all repos.
# If you would like to add a hook to a single repo, 
# you can create a .pre-commit-config.local.yaml. 
# It has the same format as this file.
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks
    rev: v8.15.0 # The GitHub action uses `latest` but that isn't supported here

      - id: gitleaks
